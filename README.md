# Real Estate

This is a vanilla PHP implementation of a platform for trading real estate. It's built on PHP 8.1 and MySQL.

## Features
TBD.  
## Framework
This is a custom backend framework that I built to make it easier to manage this project. It supports both MVC and Web 
API applications. It also has built-in dependency injection.
